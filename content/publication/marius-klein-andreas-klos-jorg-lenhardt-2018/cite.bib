 abstract = {A total engine failure poses a major threat to passengers as well as the aircraft and requires a fast decision by the pilot. We develop an assistant system to support the pilot in this decision process. An aircraft is able to glide a certain distance without thrust power by converting the potential energy of the altitude into distance. The objective of our work is to calculate an approach route which allows the aircraft to reach a suitable landing field at an appropriate altitude. This is a non-trivial problem because of many free parameters like wind direction and wind velocity. Our solution computes an approach route with two tangents and two co-rotating circular segments. For this purpose, valid approach routes can be calculated for many general cases. The method has a constant complexity and can dispense with iterative approaches. The route is calculated entirely in the wind frame which avoids complex calculations with trochoids. The central idea is to take the wind into account by moving the target towards the wind direction.},
