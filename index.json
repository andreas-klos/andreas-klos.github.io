The full loss of thrust of an aircraft requires fast and reliable decisions of the pilot. If no published landing field is within reach, an emergency landing field must be selected. The choice of a suitable emergency landing field denotes a crucial task to avoid unnecessary damage of the aircraft, risk for the civil population as well as the crew and all passengers on board. Especially in case of instrument meteorological conditions it is indispensable to use a database of suitable emergency landing fields. Thus, based on public available digital orthographic photos and digital surface models, we created various datasets with different sample sizes to facilitate training and testing of neural networks. Each dataset consists of a set of data layers. The best compositions of these data layers as well as the best performing transfer learning models are selected. Subsequently, certain hyperparameters of the chosen models for each sample size are optimized with Bayesian and Bandit optimization. The hyperparameter tuning is performed with a self-made Kubernetes cluster. The models outputs were investigated with respect to the input data by the utilization of layer-wise relevance propagation. With optimized models we created an ensemble model to improve the segmentation performance. Finally, an area around the airport of Arnsberg in North Rhine-Westphalia was segmented and emergency landing fields are identified, while the verification of the final approach's obstacle clearance is left unconsidered. These emergency landing fields are stored in a PostgreSQL database.","tags":null,"title":"Ensemble transfer learning for emergency landing field identification on moderate resource heterogeneous kubernetes cluster","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ralf Rüther","Andreas Klos","Marius Rosenbaum","Wolfram Schiffmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"46af1ba1dae4c20a55f4f4f169e0274f","permalink":"https://andreas-klos.github.io/publication/ruther-2020/","publishdate":"2021-01-23T21:50:04.630083Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ruther-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The interest in developing smart cities has increased dramatically in recent years. In this context an intelligent transportation system depicts a major topic. The forecast of traffic flow is indispensable for an efficient intelligent transportation system. The traffic flow forecast is a difficult task, due to its stochastic and non linear nature. Besides classical statistical methods, neural networks are a promising possibility to predict future traffic flow. In our work, this prediction is performed with various recurrent neural networks. These are trained on measurements of induction loops, which are placed in intersections of the city. We utilized data from beginning of January to the end of July in 2018. Each model incorporates sequences of the measured traffic flow from all sensors and predicts the future traffic flow for each sensor simultaneously. A variety of model architectures, forecast horizons and input data were investigated. Most often the vector output model with gated recurrent units achieved the smallest error on the test set over all considered prediction scenarios. Due to the small amount of data, generalization of the trained models is limited.","tags":["Deeplearning ˙ RNN ˙ LSTM ˙ GRU ˙ Traffic Forecast"],"title":"Traffic Flow Forecast of Road Networks with Recurrent Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Litzinger","Andreas Klos","Wolfram Schiffmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"2b03883243ffd5a406e992b446c28f62","permalink":"https://andreas-klos.github.io/publication/litzinger-2019/","publishdate":"2021-01-23T21:50:04.629496Z","relpermalink":"/publication/litzinger-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"A neural network's topology greatly influences its generalization ability. Many approaches to topology optimization employ heuristics, for example genetic algorithms, oftentimes consuming immense computational resources. In this contribution, we present a genetic algorithm for network topology optimization which can be deployed effectively in low-resource settings. To this end, we utilize the TensorFlow framework for network training and operate with several techniques reducing the computational load. The genetic algorithm is subsequently applied to the MNIST image classification task in two different scenarios.","tags":["Genetic algorithms","Neural Architecture Search","Neural networks"],"title":"Compute-Efficient Neural Network Architecture Optimization by a Genetic Algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Klos","Marius Rosenbaum","Wolfram Schiffmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b8455ee9859b9659904e1c0b5afcd30e","permalink":"https://andreas-klos.github.io/publication/klos-2019/","publishdate":"2021-01-23T21:50:04.629805Z","relpermalink":"/publication/klos-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["aviation","elevation data","emergency landing field","image processing","processing","satellite imagery processing"],"title":"Multi-Modal Image Processing Pipeline for a Reliable Emergency Landing Field Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marius Klein","Andreas Klos","Jörg Lenhardt","Wolfram Schiffmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"f9c52201fd890b96c815a612bb53d6f7","permalink":"https://andreas-klos.github.io/publication/marius-klein-andreas-klos-jorg-lenhardt-2018-a/","publishdate":"2021-01-23T21:50:04.630793Z","relpermalink":"/publication/marius-klein-andreas-klos-jorg-lenhardt-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Engineering refers to the practice of organising the design and construction of any artifice which transforms the physical world around us to meet some recognised need.","tags":null,"title":"Moving target approach for wind-aware flight path generation Marius","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marius Klein","Andreas Klos","Jörg Lenhardt","Wolfram Schiffmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"73694fc077c4c92e24ade4bd3e96fc7c","permalink":"https://andreas-klos.github.io/publication/marius-klein-andreas-klos-jorg-lenhardt-2018/","publishdate":"2021-01-23T21:50:04.628429Z","relpermalink":"/publication/marius-klein-andreas-klos-jorg-lenhardt-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"A total engine failure poses a major threat to passengers as well as the aircraft and requires a fast decision by the pilot. We develop an assistant system to support the pilot in this decision process. An aircraft is able to glide a certain distance without thrust power by converting the potential energy of the altitude into distance. The objective of our work is to calculate an approach route which allows the aircraft to reach a suitable landing field at an appropriate altitude. This is a non-trivial problem because of many free parameters like wind direction and wind velocity. Our solution computes an approach route with two tangents and two co-rotating circular segments. For this purpose, valid approach routes can be calculated for many general cases. The method has a constant complexity and can dispense with iterative approaches. The route is calculated entirely in the wind frame which avoids complex calculations with trochoids. The central idea is to take the wind into account by moving the target towards the wind direction.","tags":null,"title":"Wind-Aware Emergency Landing Assistant Based on Dubins Curves","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
